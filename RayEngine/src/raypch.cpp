// raypch.cpp: This file triggers the compilation of the precompiled header.
// Typically, all stable and infrequently-changing headers are included in raypch.h

#include "raypch.h"

// When using precompiled headers, the build system will compile this once,
// speeding up subsequent compilation of translation units that include raypch.h.

// No additional code is required here; keep this file minimal to maximize PCH efficiency.
